## How to Prepare

Whether adults, youth, or children, we are all ministers of God's kingdom. Come prepared in the love of Jesus, and trust God to work through each of us!

### For Adults and Youth

As leaders and examples in the outreach, adults and youth help facilitate worship, share the Gospel, and model Christ's love to people whom God has prepared.

- Review and practice the [Praise & Worship](/ministry/praise-worship) songs so you can praise with confidence
- Familiarize yourself with the [Gospel Bookmark](ministry/evangelism/gospel-bookmark.md) and think about how you want to share the Gospel
- Pray for spiritual preparation, God's guidance to people in need, and His wisdom in fellowship
- Bring a loving heart and be ready to listen with compassion

### For Children

Our children are an important part of our outreach. They join us in sharing God's love with other children.

- Learn the children's [Praise & Worship](/ministry/praise-worship) songs so you can sing (and dance) with other kids
- Learn about the [Gospel Bookmark](ministry/evangelism/gospel-bookmark.md) so you can tell others about Jesus
- Think about how Jesus loves all children and how you can share that love
- Pray for the children you will meet and ask God to help you be brave and kind

## How to Conduct Outreach

0. **Spiritual Preparation** - Before the outreach, we individually prepare our hearts through personal prayer and reflection, asking God for open hearts, divine appointments, and boldness to share His love.

1. **Praise & Worship** - We begin each evangelism outing with corporate praise and worship at the outreach location, creating a joyful atmosphere that honors God and draws people to us.

2. **Children's Ministry** - We invite children to join us in singing and dancing to children's praise songs, creating a joyful, welcoming atmosphere that draws families and passersby.

3. **Finding Opportunities** - We look for people who seem open to conversation in public spaces like parks, playgrounds, shopping areas, or community events.

4. **Brief Conversations** - We approach people warmly and ask if they'd be willing to read a short message about God's love. The bookmark takes less than two minutes to read.

5. **The Six-Point Message** - We walk through the [Gospel Bookmark](ministry/evangelism/gospel-bookmark.md)'s six points, allowing the simple illustrations and messages to communicate the Good News clearly.

6. **Gift and Prayer** - We give them the bookmark to keep and offer to pray for them if they are open to it.

7. **Respectful Closure** - We respect their responses and thank them for their time, whether they're interested or not.

## Join Us

We regularly organize street evangelism outreaches where team members can participate together. Whether you are experienced in sharing your faith or this would be your first time, everyone is welcome.
