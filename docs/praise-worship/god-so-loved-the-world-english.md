# God So Loved the World

<h3>Scott Brenner</h3>

## Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
As high as the heavens are above the earth  
As far as the waters cover all the seas  
So high, so great is the love You have for me  

**[Verse 2]**  
As far as the east is from the west  
You've taken away my worthlessness  
You've turned my shame into joyful praise  
​  
**[Chorus]**  
Forever I will thank You for the grace You've given me  
I once was lost, but now I'm found, You're everything I need  
I worship You, I live for You, You're all that I desire  
And forever I will live to tell of Your unfailing love  
​  
**[Bridge]**  
God so loved the world that He gave His only Son  
That whoever believes in Him should never die but have eternal life  
  
I believe  
In the risen Son of God
