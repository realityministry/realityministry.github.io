# 부르신 곳에서 (At the Place Where You Call)

<h3>Lyrics: 김준영 (Junyoung Kim), Music: 송은정 (Eunjeong Song)</h3>

## Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
God of love and kindness; Your presence in me  
You cover me with peace, in Your loving embrace  
I want none but You  

**[Verse 2]**  
Light of truth and love, shining in me  
You cover me with peace, in your loving embrace  
Your love is all that I see  

**[Chorus]**  
At the place where You call, I worship You Lord  
Wherever I am, I give You my praise  
At the place where You call, I worship You Lord  
Wherever I am, Oh Lord, I worship You  

**[Bridge]**  
Everywhere I go I praise you  
Everything I do I lift up  
My life to you I worship you
