# 당신은 사랑받기 위해 태어난 사람 (You Are Created to Receive the Greatest Love)

<h3>Original Song: 이민섭 (Minsup Lee); Translation: Jinho D. Choi</h3>


## Lyrics

**[Verse]**  
You are created to receive the greatest love  
This love that you have received in every portion of your life  

You are created to receive the greatest love  
This love that you have received in every portion of your life  

God's love for you has been there from the beginning of time  
And it bears the fruit of love through our gathering  

What sweet joy fills our hearts just because you are in this world  
It's His love that brings you here now to fill you with this joy  

**[Chorus]**  
You are created to receive the greatest love  
You are receiving love, right here, right now  

You are created to receive the greatest love  
You are receiving love, right here, right now
