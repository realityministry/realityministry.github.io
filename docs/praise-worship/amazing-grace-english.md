# Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)

<h3>Chris Tomlin</h3>

## Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost, but now I'm found  
Was blind, but now I see  

**[Verse 2]**  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  

**[Verse 3]**  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures  

**[Verse 4]**  
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow  
The sun forbear to shine  
But God who called me here below  
Will be forever mine  

You are forever mine  

**[Chorus]**  
My chains are gone, I've been set free  
My God, my Savior has ransomed me  
And like a flood His mercy reigns  
Unending love, amazing grace
