Consider a simple experiment: ask an AI to write an essay about any topic with minimal instruction. Within seconds, you will get a professional-looking piece that rivals what the average person would have produced in the pre-GenAI era—and in some cases, even matches expert-level work.

This capability has created a temporary advantage for those who know how to use AI, but this edge is quickly disappearing. Soon, everyone will master the basics of prompting AI, and simple AI-generated content will become the baseline expectation. Work produced through minimal prompts will no longer impress; in fact, failing to deliver even this baseline level will mark someone as below average.

## Personalizing AI Output

The next skill most people will develop is customizing AI-generated work to reflect their personal style. Rather than accepting AI's default choices, you will edit the wording, adjust the tone, and infuse your unique voice. For an essay, this means rewriting passages with your own expressions. For music or art, it means shaping the AI's output to match your aesthetic sensibilities.

This personalization helps your work stand out. Readers begin to recognize your particular writing style—something generic AI generation cannot replicate.

## Ideas Still Matter

However, there is a crucial limitation here. While your style may be distinctive, if the core ideas originate from AI, you are not adding genuine novelty to our cultural landscape. AI suggestions are essentially sophisticated reproductions of existing concepts.

We are already seeing this problem manifest. Consider social media platforms like YouTube—many videos simply repackage what others have already created. AI has accelerated this trend, flooding our digital spaces with derivative content that adds little to no value.

## Original Thinking

For your work to genuinely stand apart, the key is not how skillfully you refine AI output—it is whether you bring original ideas to the table. This fundamental truth remains unchanged from the "old school" approach.
When I write, I develop the complete framework of ideas myself, then use AI to help elaborate or polish the language; thus, the core thinking is still mine. When I create music with AI, I compose the central melody and lyrics, then direct the AI on instrumentation and mood. This keeps my music distinctive, even though AI assists in production.

## AI as an Equalizer for Original Thinkers

In this light, the AI era may actually be designed for people with original ideas who previously lacked the technical skills to fully realize their vision. If you have compelling storylines and character designs, you can now publish professional books without being a trained writer. If you craft beautiful melodies and meaningful lyrics, you can produce polished music without mastering every instrument or vocal technique.
These creations will stand apart from generic AI content because they originate from your unique perspective and creative vision.

## +1 for Christians

I believe original ideas do not solely come from our own minds—they are often provided by God to those who seek them. God plants ideas in prepared hearts for His purposes, working through people who are ready to bring those visions to life.
